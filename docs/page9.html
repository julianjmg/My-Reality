        <p>They finally reach their destination. At the end of the alley, there is a lone doorway that looks completely
            out of place from the gray buildings they’ve been walking between. The door is wooden with a yellow door
            frame. The air and buildings around it wave like a mirage. It warps and twists from this point. It is the
            origin of the chaos. The Diviner walks to the door and moves through it without pushing the door open. As he
            walks through the door stretches and rebounds back into place. Aaron wipes the sweat from his palms and
            proceeds through the door. As he walks through, he feels an immense amount of pressure and static running
            around his body. When he appears in the room. It's bright and the walls are all white. The Diviner stands
            against the wall camouflaged, only the gold embroidered eye contrasts from it. Beside the Diviner lies a
            white cuboidal table and resting upon it is an old yellowed scroll and a fruit . As Aaron approaches the
            table, the corners of the room begin to stretch and it feels like the room is spinning. It's that same
            feeling of vertigo when looking down from the apartment rooftop. The edge is dangerous, but there is still
            this draw that pulls him along like strings of fate twisting together to create a thread. The Diviner, no
            longer visible says, “You must read aloud and eat from the fruit. You will then have all of your answers.”
            The Diviner’s voice travels throughout the room with no walls getting lost in space and time as the sound
            travels. Aaron’s hands are magnets pulling the paper and fruit toward him. An incantation is written on the
            page and the words flow out from his mouth.</p>
