        <p>Picture frames, scattered paperwork, and assorted pens were once spread upon Aaron’s desk, but now as he
            longingly gazes at what was once his cubicle, he can only see the outlines of dust that surrounded his
            things. His office was always a soul sucking environment, but he did what he could to liven his work space.
            He had small posters pushed pinned onto his cubicle wall to maybe form a smile on his face if he was feeling
            down. The poster of a sloth saying “hang in there” appears to frown as its face warps from the poster board
            bending. Looking back at his desk after tossing away his last glint of joy, he looks at the picture frames
            in his box of possessions. He sees pictures of a life that feel so distant. Photos that he hasn’t actually
            locked eyes onto since he placed them there years ago.</p>
        <p>Ten years it has been. Ten long years and barely any recognition. Each new year working at the company felt
            like a celebration. He put his best party hat on to celebrate. But looking back now, he realizes that it was
            never a party hat, but a dunce cap that he wore. He felt stupid for believing that it was going to be
            different this year. And if not this year, then for sure the next. How could anyone blame him for thinking
            like this? He’s invested a fourth of his life into this job. To think that every achievement, every moment
            worth celebrating has led to an empty desk now ready to join this husk of a corporation.</p>
        <p>
            Aaron finishes packing his things and does a final look around the office. He stands with a tight grip on
            his box looking over the tops of the cubicles. There’s chatter between two coworkers behind him discussing
            the current layoffs. They both express relief after they find out they're still employees of the company.
            Aaron turns around which reveals his overflowing box of possessions to his coworkers. The man’s eyes bulge
            and the woman next to him looks at Aaron apologetically.
