        <p>A flock of birds fly away as Aaron approaches a park. His hands are clammy and his thoughts are muddled with
            delusions of the Diviner. He searches the patterns of peoples clothing, logos of businesses, and building
            murals for the Diviner’s sigil. It is a sickness that his mind can’t help but indulge in. He briefly rests
            at the ledge of a park fountain. He looks into the water and sees his wavering reflection. The beard that he
            once shaved twice a day has grown out into a face that is unrecognizable to him. His eyebags tug on his face
            keeping his eyes open. The water fountain is worn down and cracked on the side. Water pours out from it like
            a fresh wound, yet somehow it never runs out of water and it keeps on juggling the water, performing for the
            park’s people. He reaches into the fountain and splashes himself with water. The water runs off of his face
            down to his prickly chin and returns back to the fountain creating a small ripple. Aaron looks back to his
            reflection. Over his shoulder he sees the eye he’s been searching for. The diviner looms over his shoulder,
            giggling before he speaks, “This system failed you,” the words pressed into Aaron like icicles. “Run from me
            all you like, but the future is inevitable. You will know the true nature of this world. There is not much
            for you to lose now.” Aaron hastily turns around, but once again the Diviner is no longer there. He pushes
            himself off from the fountain and heads deeper into the city.</p>
