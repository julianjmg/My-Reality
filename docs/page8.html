        <p>“So what exactly are you?” asks Arron. The diviner kicks a small rock in front of him while he walks.</p>
        <p>“Well, I’m just like you.”</p>
        <p>“I meant physically. You aren’t human are you?”</p>
        <p>“It does not matter whether I am human or not. What matters is that we carry out our objectives”</p>
        <p>“Well, are you going to explain what these objectives are?”</p>
        <p>“I’m afraid that I cannot. That is a wall that I am unable to break. It is for you to find out whether you
            like it or not.” The pebble rock continues to clatter along.</p>
        <p>“So, you expect me to just follow along and do as you say when you can’t tell me anything?” Aaron furrows his
            brows as he follows the Diviner through this labyrinth of alleys.</p>
        <p>That would be optimal. I am just trying to complete my role”</p>
        <p>“You’re just trying to complete your role?” he asks. Aaron moves in front of the diviner and sweeps aside the
            stone from him. “I'm just trying to live what’s left of my broken life. My wife. Gone. My daughter. Gone. My
            Job. Gone. Hell, even my apartment, man. I have nothing,” The stone rolls into a wall and cracks open. “I’ve
            been trying to keep it together, but it always gets worse. Is it me? Am I the problem?” The Diviner chuckles
            and looks up to the sky.</p>
        <p>“Perhaps you do not understand the gravity of the situation. Look up.” Aaron reluctantly looks to the sky.
            The buildings that once stood high and mighty towering over the city are now stretched and bent,
            constricting and the view of the firmament. The Diviner continues, “Now you must realize there is a greater
            power at play” He grabs a half of the cracked rock and tosses it high up into the air. Like the buildings,
            it bends and warps. Its path motion stains a section of the air with a stone texture. The Diviner faces
            Aaron, “You were designed to fail.” He turns around and continues to keep moving forward. Aaron considers
            the unexplainable skyscape and slowly trails behind the Diviner.</p>
