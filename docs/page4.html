        <p>The key begrudgingly moves into the rusted lock and gets stuck mid rotation. After a few frustrated shakes,
            the door unlocks and swings open to a sad shell of a home. As he closes the door behind him, he places his
            box down beside him and slides his back down the door clutching his head. The walls of the apartment are a
            dingy gray stained with adhesive and pieces of wallpaper that hasn't fallen off on its own yet. As he sits
            on the cold wooden floor, sounds of light but heavy footsteps echo through his mind in quick succession.
            Before she would turn the corner and run into his arms after work, her pink light up sneakers would cast
            blue and red lights on the wall. She would stomp extra hard just to make sure the lights on her shoes were
            going off so her presence was well none. Now the room is empty. The only thing rushing towards him at the
            door is the bone chilling air from a window that can’t close properly, or maybe it's the water dripping from
            the exposed pipes in the ceiling falling into a plastic bucket beside him. He pulls himself up from the
            ground and walks to the couch. In his spot, the leather of the cushion is worn and deflated. As he sits, the
            cushion’s divot widens and cradles his slumped posture. He looks to the cushion beside him. Its filling is
            not compressed by the weight and time of another, not compacted by the emotions and memories of another.
            This weighs on him and the weight pushes him deeper and deeper into his mind where he is pulled in by his
            grief and entrapped by his guilt. The porous gray walls reflect a flashing red and blue light causing
            Aaron’s head to lift, but the sound of a glaring police car siren pierces any hope he had.</p>
        <p>A few days pass by. Aaron awakens to a heavy disgruntled growl of an upset man outside his door. The couch
            spits him out from its deep cavity knocking him onto his feet. Looking to the beaten wooden door, he sees a
            bright yellow paper that was crammed through the small gap underneath the door. Even without his glasses he
            knows that this paper is an eviction notice. He’s lost count on how many he’s received. The cold draft drags
            the yellow slip across the coarse floor creating a soft but uncomfortable grinding sound. It moves in his
            direction revealing another small paper beneath it. It was a sticky note. It waved at Aaron as the draft
            tugged and pulled, but remained resilient due to its strong adhesive. Curious, he slips his glasses onto his
            face and steps closer. Aaron stops dead in his tracks. He realizes that it’s the eye of the Diviner. He
            continues to stand there. His heart races as the eye, animated by the draft, blinks at him longingly
            awaiting a response. He feels the unsettling gaze of the diviner upon him causing his body to shake with a
            coldness. Step by step, he walks to the front door. As he approaches the door, he stomps the Diviner's eye
            to a stillness and quickly leaves his apartment.</p>
