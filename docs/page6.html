        <p>Downtown, the buildings stretch up into the sky looking down on the people commuting to work. The air is filled
        with a brisk hustle and the people move in a semi orderly fashion, they’ve been training all their lives to do
        this. Aaron slides in with the people heading to work struggling to match their pace. Off in the distance, he
        can hear the clicking of a megaphone and the voice of someone about to speak. Despite his legs being fatigued he
        pushes them even harder into the concrete and increases his pace. Even with his efforts of creating distance,
        the words of the Diviner’s were destined to meet his ears. “Whichever direction you go, whether to or away from
        me, you will reach me. It is as fate has it written,” The Diviner says. No matter where he goes or where he
        attempts to hide, the Diviner’s voice remains a constant volume no matter the distance. Even if he had ear
        plugs, His words would still ring true. Aaron looks around and the people are unfazed by the sounds. They
        continue walking as programmed. Aaron continues moving away from the sound, but at a slower pace. Moving his
        attention slightly from the Diviner, he is able to hear the conversations of the people going to work, the
        blaring ringtones, yelling, complaining, sadness, anger. He grounds his feet and listens for the words to find
        him. “I see you are willing to listen. I will come to you,” says the Diviner. The pedestrians continue to drone
        on as Aaron stands still on the sidewalk. A large man in a rush bumps into him causing to lose balance and fall
        down. From the people crossing A woman in business casual attire exits her morning trance after seeing Aaron
        knocked down to the ground and attempts to help him.</p>
