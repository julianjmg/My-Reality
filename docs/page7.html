        <p>“Are you alright? You don’t look so good,” she asks and raises her hand out to him.</p>
        <p>“I’m alright, promise.” He slides his hand back further from her against the concrete.</p>
        <p>“Please, I insist. It wouldn’t lay right on my conscience if we didn’t get you seen by someone.” Aaron looks
            around nervously, slowly moving his hand toward the woman. “No need to be so scared. You already know who I
            am, don’t you? I know who you are, Aaron of 15th and Delver street apartment number 103” she hisses. Aaron
            looks up at her face and it doesn’t make sense. Her face appears to be grafted together. Certain parts of
            the skin look deeper than others. Her lips are unnaturally thin and her mouth is taught like a drawstring
            bag. Speech should not be possible. Her ears curl in on themselves and her eyes are purely sclera, milky and
            white. Not even the clouds closer to the heavens can reach this purity of white. The eyes follow my hands
            inch ever closer to her extended arm. The strange construction of her face is disturbing but oddly enough
            trusting and raw. The strange woman helps him up with eaze and guides him to an alleyway. “Make sure you
            follow me closely. It takes several twists and turns to get to our destination,” she says.</p>
        <p>As they move through the alleyway, the woman tosses her briefcase to the ground and when it hits the
            concrete, it splats like a tomato. The briefcase begins to move and unravel forming a long white snake-like
            being that slithers up and around the woman coiling around her. It weaves within itself creating a white
            garment, stretching itself completely thin revealing the white flowing robe of the Diviner. Now with the
            robe, the Diviner’s form is much taller and wider as he floats down the alleyway.</p>
