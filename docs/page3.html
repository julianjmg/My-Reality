        <p>Further along in the distance, Aaron sees a small crowd around this guy carrying a megaphone. The guy is
            standing up on a park bench with a long white flowing robe and a hat that drapes a white cloth obscuring his
            face. The cloth has a large eye over top embroidered with a gold floss. The crowd quiets and the man
            stretches his long skeletal fingers around the handle of the megaphone. “The world is not what you think”
            the mysterious man says. Immediately, a few people start leaving, not wishing to entertain the man’s words.
            He continues, “There is so much more to our lives than this laughable 9-5 cycle. Do you honestly think this
            is our purpose? Do you honestly think our lives are up to our choosing?” Even more people begin to leave,
            but something is seriously off about this man. Despite his old withered hands and arms revealed by his
            robes, his voice has a real gusto to it. It’s so lively, but his movements are very sharp and precise like a
            puppet being controlled by its master. Aaron looks at the strange man, but as he does the man quickly turns
            his head towards Aaron. They lock eyes and Aaron looks away uncomfortably. The man continues, “I am the
            Diviner, and I wish to bring this world’s people into enlightenment. Become one of my pupils and together we
            will lift the veil of ignorance away from your eyes and see the world for what it is. Let knowledge be your
            faith and choose your own destiny. Break from the cycle” says the Diviner. Only 2 people remain from the
            crowd. Aaron continues to walk home away from the crowd, but he can’t shake the feeling that he’s being
            watched. The megaphone suddenly blares, “I’ve been expecting you.” Aaron quickly turns around. The Diviner
            and the 2 remaining people of the crowd are no longer there. It was a strange unsettling silence, but the
            city is as loud as ever. A belligerent honk snaps him out of his shock and he hastens his pace towards his
            apartment.</p>
