        <p>“Aaron, I didn't know you were standing there.” The woman steps back and holds onto her wrist. “I suppose our
            chatter may seem to be insensitive,” she says. His once glum face shifts to a grin.</p>
        <p>“Don’t even worry about it, Mary.” He leans in closer “Don’t go telling admin this, but I was planning on
            quitting soon anyhow. I got a new job lined up in a town over” Aaron lies. Both coworkers congratulate him
            and move on with their employed lives. The congratulations rang back in between his ears causing a greater
            disturbance in his mind and his teeth felt rotten from grinning out a lie. He exits the building.</p>
        <p>He looks back down into the box he’s holding. The very top photo in the box housed the image of a man and a
            woman sitting together with a little girl smiling between them. They sat on the stairs of an apartment
            building that was slightly run down, but ready to hold the words of their family story. Everything was so
            bright and saturated back then. The wallpaper that his girlfriend, Vivian, picked out was a bright green
            floral print. She chose it because together, they always dreamed of having a house with a big green yard. A
            yard with trees and a tire swing that Delilah could swing on when she was older. A field that was open and
            free. It may not have been close to their dream, but it was a stepping stone for the future. To have the
            rooms glow green when the sun beamed through the windows would have been enough until they could find a
            better home. It wasn’t originally raining in the picture, but tears gently fell from Aaron’s face onto the
            glass causing the droplets to roll down like rain on a windshield with no wipers obstructing the view. </p>
        <p>Aaron wipes his eyes and continues walking home. The sidewalk is cracked and uneven causing longer strides to
            be made in order to step over the large gaps. These cracks have been here for so long. The city never
            provides maintenance for this area. It wouldn’t be a surprise if the cracks have eroded over time to become
            even larger. These are well traveled sidewalks and people pass by on them everyday, but they still remain
            unrepaired. </p>
